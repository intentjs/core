## Introduction

Intent is a web application framework built on top of NestJS. It _intends_ to provide declarative APIs to develop and ship sophisticated solutions. While NestJS provides great syntax and structure to your application, but it lacks many things which are needed to develop a good solution.

In a real world scenario, it is likely that you will need many things like authentication, database integration, web views and what not. This is exactly what Intent wants to solve for you.

Intent aims to provide a good developer experience while providing powerful features like database integration, queue integration, event listeners, task scheduling etc.

Intent provides necessary feature-integrations out of the box.
